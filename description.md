## Epi Wizard

&nbsp;

### Outline of the App:

Epi Wizard is an interactive app using the newly designed 'Epicalculator' package. This app contains tools specifically designed for epidemiological data analysis. We've thoughtfully included calculators for risk data, person-time data, odds ratio measurements and other common measurement parameters (e.g. Attributable Risk and Population Attributable Risk). The app is designed to output the estimated effects with 95% confidence intervals and provide a graphical comparison of crude and summary estimates. Other applications are available for crude data calculations. More functions such as chi-square hypothesis testing of homogeneity are available in the R package 'Epicalculator'.

&nbsp;

### Audience:

Majorly Epidemiology concentrated student, researchers can also use it for some quick calculations.

&nbsp;

### Data Input Instruction:

For risk calculations, both crude and stratified data can be entered as text separated by commas.
Crude data format
(exposed people with disease, unexposed people with disease, exposed people without disease, unexposed people without disease).
Summary data format is the same, just remember to use a comma to separate data from different stratified table.

For rate calculations, both crude and stratified data can be entered as text separated by commas.
Crude data format:
(exposed people with disease, unexposed people with disease, exposed person-time, unexposed person-time).
Summary data format is the same, just remember to use a comma to separate data from different stratified table.
