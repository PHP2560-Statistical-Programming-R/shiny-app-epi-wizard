## Feedback 12-12-2017

- I like that when I first run this app it installs necessary packages. 
- For your Introduction, create a nice markdown document to describe things. You can then use 

`includeMarkdown("RMarkdownFile.rmd")`

- You may want to add a way for the user to load their own csv file into this so they can use excel data directly. 
- For help on this you can see the linear regression app fro mspring 2016 or the counties app from fall 2016. 


## Feedback from Class Presntations

### What your classmates liked

- nice design, useful direct application
- Specialized tool.
- The Epi students would love this. Love the applicability
- Simple, quick input for data. 
- This app is incredibly useful for epidemiologists. The introduction and design is easy to use as well.
- I like the introduction page and it's very practical to use.
- Good app for students in epidemiology class.
- great instructions on the home page and great concept that will be very useful for intro to epi students
- "They placed the introduction in the first tab, which makes the app more readable. 
And it used the knowledge we learned from epidemiology class. The interface looks clear and nice.They also set the download button for the plot."
- I liked the usefulness of it for the public health aspects
- a lot of functions in one place 
- Very useful for anyone interested in epidemiology
- An instruction tab would be useful for the app to be more user-friendly.
- "Help users save a lot of time on calculating the measurements in epi. 
- Included the instraction on how to install the data.
- the comparison on summary and crude association measurement on graph"
"- I love the idea!
- Well organized and labeled "
- I think the idea to make an epi app is good. Something like this would have been useful for the intro class
- It's useful in epidemiology study.
- This is my team's app
- Useful for Epi students.
- It was a useful app, especially as someone who took epi and had hw it could be utilized well.
- It seems like a very useful tool for epi students, I wouldn't know though? I think the plots are great and you should include them regardless of user input, it will balance out your page a lot more.
- Very practical tool for Epidemiology concentrated students
- Good for epidemiology students. The equations are easy to compute
"- useful app for epidemiologist
- nice plot"
- The usefulness, collaboration and ease of use
- It's practical and I like the design of this app.


### Suggested Changes

- allow researchers to enter data via files rather than by hand?
- General ui, font on main page a bit small. Include a title panel. A lot of text in instruction
- Maybe add an interpretation to the results which Epi students would love even more.
- More of an explanation of list order of #'s when inputting data for risk ratio
An option to click yes or no rather than entering it in would be better. If there was a way to upload data, that'd make this app more powerful too.
- I hope there is instruction on how to enter the input in this app.  
- It's able to analyze research data.
- your output is a bit plain, maybe add some styling to the values you output - for example when you print out the risk ratios, they are just small plain text on the side of the screen, maybe you could display these values larger and consider including a one or two sentence interpretation of that value
- Maybe they can add some interpretation to the results. When the user run the app, it can return both the results and interpretation. Also when the user enter data, it can also show the input data table in the output.
- Improve the layout of the page
arrangement of tabs, data input and output 
- I think the visuals could be better/improved and maybe an appendix/glossary included to help the users understand epidemiology terms if they are not familiar
- This app needs more visualization.
- add interactive button so that users can change the confidential interval, and can add interpretation of the data.
- I would label the graphs
- I think the input for 2x2 tables could be improved. I think it would be useful to include the interpretations of the measures of association. 
- The font is a little bit small. Could add more graphs.
- adding example 2X2 table/tables and showing how to enter that data and interpret the result
- Add some info about other courses?
- Maybe there could be more visuals and the input of the values to calculate ratios could be individual boxes instead of separating by commas. 
- Maybe describe the limitations and parameters of the tools? And instead of a yes no type, do a check box? 



### Changes to be made before turning it in

- Fix the introduction tab, I cannot get it to load right now. Also adjust the font sizes on this page, you may want to include some screenshots to help the user.
- Students asked for interpretations, maybe include a link to a good webpage that explains the test being done instead to help guide their work. 
- The app [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42778522/in-r-adding-multiple-rshiny-actionbutton-or-selectinput-widgets-to-one-row) had input that was in a 2x2 table format. They used selectInput but I think you could do it with typing and just let the user enter a 2x2 table into it. 
- Wok with the font and appearance to adjust some things
I think it's good
The fonts should be bigger. They should use a drop-down menu for ‘show plot’ rather than typing in "TRUE" or "FALSE".
- add interpretation for measures of association
none
Now the app is blank is each part,  and maybe more content should be added.
